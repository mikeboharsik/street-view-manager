# Street View Manager

There are numerous problems with Google's current Street View client offering from a management perspective:

* There is only one official client that allows personal Street View photo management and it is a mobile-only app
* Some basic functionality is simply easier with a PC than a mobile device (e.g. modifying lat/long coordinates for a photo)
* Basic functionality is missing from the official app (e.g. modifying lat/long coordinates for a photo)

This project aims to overcome these issues by providing a browser-based application that supports all functionality offered by [the Street View Publish API](https://developers.google.com/streetview/publish/reference/rest).

# Usage

This is a React application built on top of `create-react-app`. As such, you generally will run `yarn start` to test local changes and `yarn build` to build whatever you are going to host somewhere. My assumption is that if you are reading this then you know about these things already.
